Lemonade App replica with Flutter.

Screenshots are in 'screenshots' folder

Implemented 3 screens: Splash with animations, Intro with PageView and Chat screen with side menu. 
No logic behind (no network calls, no field checks). Primitive logic is implemented in widget itself. 

Works from the box on iOS and Android.

Used libraries: Rive (former Flare, animations), flutter_icons (facebook icon).

Implemented within 7 hours (3 hours took splash animation).
